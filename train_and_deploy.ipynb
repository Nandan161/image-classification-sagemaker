    "# Dog Image Classification using AWS SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook lists all the steps that you need to complete the complete this project. You will need to complete all the TODOs in this notebook as well as in the README and the two python scripts included with the starter code.\n",
    "In this project, we leverage AWS SageMaker to train and deploy an image classification model using transfer learning. Our goal is to classify dog breeds from images using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN). \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook demonstrates a full machine learning lifecycle:  \n",
    "- Data download and upload to S3  \n",
    "- Model training using transfer learning  \n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning using SageMaker’s built-in tools  \n",
    "- Debugging and profiling  \n",
    "- Model deployment and inference using a hosted endpoint  \n",
    "\n",
    "This serves as a real-world simulation of how ML Engineers build and deploy scalable image classification models using AWS infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO**: Give a helpful introduction to what this notebook is for. Remember that comments, explanations and good documentation make your project informative and professional.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This notebook has a bunch of code and markdown cells with TODOs that you have to complete. These are meant to be helpful guidelines for you to finish your project while meeting the requirements in the project rubrics. Feel free to change the order of these the TODO's and use more than one TODO code cell to do all your tasks."
